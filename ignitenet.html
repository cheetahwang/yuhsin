            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>IgniteNet Cloud Controller is a B2B a scalable wireless access point management system, serves 200+ users
                from 50+ countries, including the US, Japan, and Thailand.</p>
            <p>It has a powerful structure(3 levels structure: Cloud, Site, and Device) to help users manage a huge
                network.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>In this project, I designed a new feature "Add a note" which saves users' time. It allows users to add
                notes on the cloud so that they can check any work-related information on the cloud instead of looking
                for it on laptops or notebooks.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for the whole design stage, from concepts to the final design solution and the design
                spec. I collaborated with the product owner and developers to design a simple way to solve users'
                problems and for developers, it didn't take much effort to deploy.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Our users</h4>
            <p>The data was collected through Google Analytics, based on it and the user interviews to generate the
                persona.</p>

            <br>
            <p>According to the persona, I knew users' biggest goal is to provide stable internet and solve problems as
                soon as possible</p>

            <br>
            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>Users manage large network, they need to remember much information to help them work, like the network
                settings, device locations. Users usually note them everywhere, such as write down in the notebooks or
                somewhere on the laptops. It wastes their time to look for what they need.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">"As customer support, I need to remember much information to help me
                    manage several huge networks so that
                    I can maintain the network and solve the internet issue in the shortest time"</span></p>
            <br>
            <h6>The picture top-left: The user listed all IP addresses which are in the same network and printed them

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <br>
            <h4>Design principle</h4>
            <p>Through persona, scenarios, and internal discussion, I defined the design principle: Flexible, Efficient,
                and Visible.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>The idea was to allow users to add notes in the cloud. If we have a "note" for users so that they can use
                it to remember work-related information in the cloud, they don't need other tools to help them.</p>
            <p>The exact location to put the note feature needed to conduct tests to find the best solution.</p>
            <p>
                In order to contain any information users might note, I designed a simple input field. It didn't have
                any unnecessary element, anything in this input field was needed: the title is to remind users which
                site/device is the note for; the placeholder is to educate users how can they use; the buttons are for
                them to finish the task.
                In this way, it gives users the biggest flexibility, lowering the learning curve, and improving working
                efficiency.</p>
            <p>I ideated three versions, made prototypes, then I tested them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <br>
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <br>
            <img src="img/ig_a.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>I put the add note feature on the left side menu so that users can use this note no matter which pages
                they visit. Devices inherit in the same site share the same note, user can read all related notes with
                less effort.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/ig_b.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>Since the note is about information, I put it in the device information section/dashboard at the device
                level. At the site level, I used the widget form to display it on the dashboard because the dashboard is
                the most visited page.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/ig_c.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>I put the note at the header and used the defined secondary button style defined in the design system so
                that developers can deploy it quickly. The header place is visible and easy to access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <br>
            <h4>Usability tests</h4>
            <p>The result showed that the version C was better. </p>
            <p>Because version A, the note location at let menu was not visible enough for users to use it. Although
                it's most accessible, its logic was different from the current cloud, and users were confused by it.</p>
            <p>About version B, the device level note location was reasonable for users. But at the site level, the
                note was not easy to get access to. </p>
            <p>Version C has better accessibility than version B. One more reason I decided version C is because
                it used the defined components, it kept system consistency and save deployment much effort.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9">
            <br>
            <h4>Iteration</h4>
            <img src="img/ig_final01.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Flexible, Efficient and Visible.</span></p>
            <p>I wanted to solve the [version C]unified issue of the button at site level and device level. Since it's
                the new feature, users were not familiar with it, enhancing the consistency helped them know how to use
                it quickly.</p>
            <p>At the device level, there was already much information, adding a label to button resulted in the header
                looked too complex. I unified the buttons with the text button style defined in the design system and
                moved the note to a more noticeable place.</p>
